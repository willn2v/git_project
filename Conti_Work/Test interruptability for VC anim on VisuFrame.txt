Test Interruptability for VC anim on VisuFrame

1. Steps to test interruptability
There would be 3 steps to test an interruptability
	1. Trigger the first animation
	2. Let the first animation run for a while
	3. Trigger the second animation to interrupt the first one
	
In ScriptEngine of VisuFrame, write a script to achieve these 3 steps. The content of the script will include 3 parts:
	1. Set APIs to trigger the first animation
	2. Send WAIT command
	3. Set APIs to trigger the second animation

2. How to use Script Engine
	1. Set APIs
	There are 2 ways to set APIs in the script:
	1. Using command <command here>
	* Command syntax:
	<Command syntax here>
	* Example:
	<Example here>
	-> Set API "" to 1
	
	2. Using command <command here>
	* Command syntax:
	<Command syntax here>
	* Get the parameters for command:
	- Manually set an API
	- In the communication log, copy the sent command:
	
	- Put the command in <COMMAND>
	* Example:
	3. WAIT command
	
	4. Run
	

3. Example
Below is an example of the script to test the seft interrupt between Volume popups:
* Script:
<>
or

4. More about Script Engine
A part from setting API or Wait commands, there is also a bunch of other commands that can be used in the script, e.g. sending up/down/left/right keys, .

The commands can be saved in a js file for latter use.
For more examples, refer to sample js files in this location:
